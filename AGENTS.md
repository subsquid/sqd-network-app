# Project Agent Guide

> Scope: Root project (applies to all subdirectories unless overridden by a nested AGENTS.md)

## Quick Facts

- **Primary language:** TypeScript (React 19 frontend, Node.js backend)
- **Package manager:** pnpm 9 — always use `pnpm`, never `npm` or `yarn`
- **Monorepo tool:** Turborepo (`turbo.json` at root)
- **Linter / Formatter:** Biome (`biome.json` at root) — replaces ESLint + Prettier
- **Branching:** `develop` (staging/dev), `main` (production)
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions → Docker images pushed to GCR (`gcr.io/bright-meridian-316511/...`)

- **Docker** (for production image builds)

### Local Setup

```bash
cp .env.example .env   # fill in real values (see below)
pnpm install           # installs all workspaces

## Common Tasks

> Run `pnpm codegen` after any changes to GraphQL queries or contract ABIs.

### Turborepo Task Graph

The root `turbo.json` defines five tasks:

| Task      | `dependsOn`   | Notes                                                                                    |
|-----------|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `dev`     | `["^build"]`  | Starts persistent dev servers; builds `common` first; not cached                        |
| `build`   | `["^build"]`  | Builds dependencies first; outputs cached under `build/**` and `dist/**`                |
| `tsc`     | `["transit"]` | Type-check; runs in parallel across packages but cache-invalidates when deps change     |
| `lint`    | `[]`          | Biome check + fix; runs in parallel across all packages, no inter-package dependencies  |
| `transit` | `["^transit"]`| Virtual transit node — no script, creates cache-invalidation links between packages    |

`packages/client/turbo.json` extends the root and adds the full list of build-time environment variables to the `build` task (so Turbo cache-busts on env changes).

**Key rules for agents working with Turbo in this repo:**
- Always use `turbo run <task>` in scripts and CI — never the bare `turbo <task>` shorthand.
- Do not chain Turbo tasks with `&&`; use `dependsOn` in `turbo.json` instead.
- The `transit` task is a transit node pattern: it holds no script but propagates cache hashes from upstream packages, allowing `tsc` to run in parallel while correctly invalidating when any dependency's source changes.
- To run a single package: `npx turbo run build --filter=@subsquid/client`
- To run only what changed vs a branch: `npx turbo run build --affected`

---

## Testing & Quality Gates

- **Test suite:** Vitest — run `pnpm test` to execute every package's specs.
  - `@subsquid/client` ships two Vitest projects:
    - `unit` — jsdom + Testing Library + wagmi mock connector + canned viem
      transports. Fast, parallel, no Anvil required.
      Filter: `pnpm --filter @subsquid/client test:unit`.
    - `integration` — jsdom in single-fork mode, backed by Anvil + the
      mini-indexer + an in-process tRPC server (all spun up by
      `@subsquid/mock-stack`'s `startMockStack()`). Requires Foundry.
      Filter: `pnpm --filter @subsquid/client test:integration`.
  - `@subsquid/mock-stack` runs a parity test enumerating every named
    GraphQL operation in `packages/server/graphql/*.graphql` and asserting
    a resolver exists.
- **Foundry prerequisite (integration tests + mock mode):** install with
  `curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash && foundryup`.
- **Mock dev workflow (two processes):**
  - `pnpm mock:chain` — long-lived: anvil + deploy harness + GraphQL on
    ports 8545/4321. Start once per session in its own terminal.
  - `pnpm mock:app` — vite (client) + tRPC server, both with watch mode.
    Reads chain endpoints from `packages/mock-stack/.deployments.json`
    and waits if the file isn't there yet.
  - `pnpm mock` runs both at once for one-off work.
- **Tests** auto-run `forge build` and the deploy harness on the first
  invocation; subsequent runs reuse `packages/mock-stack/.anvil-state.json`.
  Anvil and the GraphQL server bind to ephemeral ports for tests so
  concurrent runs don't collide on the dev mode's pinned 8545/4321.
- **Linting:** Biome — run `pnpm lint` before committing.
- **Type-check:** `pnpm tsc` runs `tsc --noEmit` across all packages.
- **Generated files:** Never edit `packages/server/src/generated/` or any `*.generated.*` files by hand; always regenerate with `pnpm codegen`.
- **Import order:** Biome enforces a specific import order (Node built-ins → react → third-party → internal aliases). The internal aliases `@components`, `@contexts`, `@hooks`, `@api`, `@network`, `@lib` are grouped last.

---

## Workflow Expectations

- **Branches:** Feature branches off `develop`; `develop` → `main` for releases.
- **CI triggers:** Pushing to `develop` or `main` automatically builds and deploys Docker images to GCR for the affected package.
  - `build-web.yaml` builds both `mainnet` and `tethys` variants as a matrix job.
  - `build-server.yaml` builds a single server image.
- **Network variants:** The client is deployed twice per environment — once for `mainnet`, once for `tethys`. Ensure UI changes work for both (the active network is driven by `NETWORK` env var at build time).
- **Feature flags:** `ENABLE_DEMO_FEATURES=true` is set on `develop` builds. Gate experimental UI behind this flag via the config context.
- **Secrets:** WalletConnect project IDs differ per network variant (see CI workflow). Never hardcode project IDs.

---

## Architecture Notes

- The **client** talks exclusively to the **server** via tRPC (not directly to the Squid GraphQL API or the blockchain). The server aggregates and transforms data from:
  1. Squid GraphQL APIs (indexed on-chain state)
  2. Direct Arbitrum RPC calls via `viem`
- The **common** package exposes contract ABIs and addresses shared by both client and server.
- Wallet connectivity uses **RainbowKit + wagmi v2** targeting Arbitrum One (mainnet) or Arbitrum Sepolia (tethys).
- UI is built with **MUI v7**.

---

## Documentation Duties

- Update `README.md` when setup steps, scripts, or environment variables change materially.
- Update `.env.example` whenever new environment variables are added.
- Run `pnpm codegen` and commit the generated output whenever GraphQL queries or contract ABIs change.

---

## Finish the Task Checklist

- [ ] Run `pnpm lint` and fix any Biome errors before committing
- [ ] Run `pnpm tsc` to confirm no TypeScript errors
- [ ] Run `pnpm test` to confirm Vitest specs still pass (Foundry required for integration project)
- [ ] Run `pnpm codegen` if GraphQL queries or contract ABIs were modified
- [ ] Update `.env.example` if new environment variables were introduced
- [ ] Update `README.md` if setup instructions or scripts changed
- [ ] Summarize changes in conventional commit format (e.g., `feat: ...`, `fix: ...`, `chore: ...`, `refactor: ...`)
